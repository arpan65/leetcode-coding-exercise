    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "we can solve the problem using a recursive back tracking approach, the important points to keep in mind are, we can use an element multiple times and no duplicate combinations are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each index of the input array, either we can pick it or not pick it. Suppose arr=[2,3,6,7] with target=7\n",
    "at index =0 we can either choose to pick 2 or not pick 2, which ensures that the final combinations will be unique.\n",
    "(it can either have or not have a 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now after picking 2 (we will maintain a data sctructure to keep track of the picked elements) we are left with elements [3,6,7] and target=7-2=5\n",
    "\n",
    "In next step we can again have same options: pick the 2 or not pick the 2\n",
    " so at each step there are three possibilities that can happen:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. target=0 which means we got a valid combination, add the current picks (the datastructure we are maintaining) to the result list\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. target<0 which means with the remaining elements we cannot acheive the target, return immidiately\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. now if target>0 we will add the current element to the data structure, invoke the backtrack again with the current target = target - current element\n",
    " \n",
    " Note: each time we are doing back tracking in case we can not get a valid combination with the last picked element, we need to remove the element\n",
