    "Let's understand how we can solve this problem using bottom up dynamic programming.\n",
    "Suppose we can use denominations of [1,3,4,5] and the amount we need is 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if ask what is the minimal way that we can get a 0, its 0 right?\n",
    "Similarly if we want the amount of 1 there is only one way. But how have we got it?\n",
    "if we check all the denominations up to amount one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "we need a 1:\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "    For each coin in denominations\n",
    "    if we use 1, the amount left is 1-1=0, so we can take it.it, so now the question is in how many ways we can do it. So it will be 1+ ways to get(1-1)=1+0=1 right?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if we use 3, the amount left is 1-3=-2, so we can't take it\n",
    "    similarly we can't take 4 or 5\n",
    "    \n",
    "so to make the amount of 1 we have 1 ways\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a 2:\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "    For each coin in denominations\n",
    "    if we use 1, the amount left is 2-1=1, so we can take it, so again if we ask, how many ways we can do it? it will be 1+ ways to get(2-1)=1+1=2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if we use 3, the amount left is 2-3=-1, so we can't take it\n",
    "    similarly we can't take 4 or 5\n",
    "    \n",
    "so to make the amount of 2 we have 2 ways  \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a 3:\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "    For each coin in denominations\n",
    "    if we use 1, the amount left is 3-1=2, so we can take it, so again if we ask, how many ways we can do it? it will be 1+ ways to get(3-1)=1+2=3\n",
    "    [Is it the answer? wait let's check our other alternatives]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if we use 3, the amount left is 3-3=0, so we can also take it. In that case we can do it 1+ways to get(3-3)=1+0=1 ways. Its lesser than our previous alternative..\n",
    "    we can't take 4 or 5 as they are greater than 3\n",
    "    \n",
    "..........\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we get the intuition we need to calculate it upto the required amount, and in the process we will maintain an array dp[] which will contain all the values in bottom up manner. So when we need to calculate the ways to get 3 we already have calculated the ways to get a and 2.\n",
